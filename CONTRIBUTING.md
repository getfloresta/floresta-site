# Contributing to Floresta

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Floresta. It's people like you that make the open source community such a great place.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/cristiansolutchak/floresta-site/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/cristiansolutchak/floresta-site/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `develop`.
2.  Name your branch following the pattern `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/new-component`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Ensure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- Use Conventional Commits format:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Thank you for your contribution!
